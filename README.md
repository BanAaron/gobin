# gobin

GoBin is a simple tool to move things to trash from the cli. This means files are recoverable and therefore less destructive than using `rm -rf` for example.

# To Do

- [x] store data in json format
- [x] store deleted files as a uuid with the original name and path in the json
- [ ] restore files based on json data
